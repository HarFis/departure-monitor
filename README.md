# Personal Departure Monitor

## Description

I usually just left the house without checking. To avoid running, missing busses, avoiding waiting in the cold, I needed an easy way to check the departure times of VÃ¤sttrafik's busses at my stop before leaving the house. Since I can use busses in both directions to get to the center, the monitor shows the (next 3) departures for both directions.
